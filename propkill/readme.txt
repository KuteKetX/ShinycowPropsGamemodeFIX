Modules (located in gamemode/modules/) are additions to the gamemode that aren't neccesary.

YOU WILL WANT TO LOOK THROUGH THE MODULES FOLDER FOR THINGS THAT YOU MAY NOT WANT LIKE sv_hostname.lua

Feel free to edit them (if you know what you're doing) or remove them entirely.

Removing them won't interfere with the gamemode.



IF YOU WANT THIS GAMEMODE IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE OTHER PROPKILL SERVERS:
	
	1.) Rename the gamemode folder from 'props' to 'propkill'
	2.) Rename this directory's 'props.txt' to 'PropKill.txt'
	3.) Open up the newly named 'PropKill.txt' and edit first line from "props" to "PropKill"
